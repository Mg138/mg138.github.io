I'm a transgender woman. I'm a *Professional Programmer* and a *Hobbyist Translator*.

I used to study at *Daan Vocational High School*, \\
but after a year of learning nothing new, I left the school behind and *started learning myself*.

I had been learning *The C Programming Language* since junior high. \\
And then I picked up *Java/Kotlin*, for modding a sandbox game called *'Minecraft'* \\
And then, *where we are right now* (2022), I've picked up *web design*.

I'm also a *hobbyist translator*. \\
I've been learning *English* as my second language since *junior high*. \\
And since then, it's gotten *better and better* over time.

As for my native language, it is *Chinese*. <small>(Heh. Speaking two of the most used language worldwide...)</small>
